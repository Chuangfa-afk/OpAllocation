# OpAllocation - Advanced Asset Allocation System

## Introduction

OpAllocation is a cutting-edge tool designed to optimize investment portfolios through data-driven asset allocation. It enables investors to define a set of assets, such as stock symbols, and provides efficient allocation percentages aimed at maximizing portfolio performance using historical data and financial analysis.

## Key Features

- **User-Defined Asset Selection**: Allows users to input their choice of stock symbols or other asset types for analysis.
  
- **Sophisticated Financial Models**: Utilizes advanced financial tools like mean-variance analysis and Sharpe ratio for performance evaluation.
  
- **Beta Coefficient Analysis**: Calculates the beta coefficient to gauge asset volatility relative to the market.
  
- **Correlation Matrix**: Analyzes the inter-relationship between thousands of assets to inform allocation decisions.
  
- **Customizable Data Range**: Offers flexibility in historical data analysis, with a default period of 10 years but options for adjustment.
  
- **Optimal Portfolio Allocation**: Recommends the most effective allocation percentages for each chosen asset based on performance maximization.
  
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Features a Flask-built web interface for a straightforward user experience in inputting assets and receiving portfolio recommendations.
  
- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Fetches the latest financial data using 'yfinance', ensuring current and relevant analysis.
  
- **Robust Error Handling**: Implements error handling and data validation to improve reliability and user experience.
  
- **Modularity for Scalability**: The systemâ€™s design allows for easy extension with more financial models, asset types, or data source integrations.

## Getting Started

The tool is designed to be user-friendly and accessible via a web interface. For local deployment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Launch the Flask server to run the web application.
4. Access the web interface through your browser at `localhost` with the specified port.

## Usage

Upon accessing the OpAllocation web interface:

1. Enter the stock symbols or other asset identifiers into the input field.
2. Specify any additional parameters such as the historical data range.
3. Submit the data for analysis.
4. Review the optimized allocation percentages, expected returns, volatility, and Sharpe ratio presented by the system.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: For creating the web interface.
- **yfinance**: To obtain real-time financial data.
- **Python**: The core programming language used for developing the financial models and backend logic.

## Future Enhancements

We are continually striving to enhance the capabilities of OpAllocation. Planned future updates include:

- Addition of more financial models for analysis.
